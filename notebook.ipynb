    "In this lab, you will learn how to convert addresses into their\n",
    "equivalent latitude and longitude values. Also, you will use the\n",
    "Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in New York City. You will use\n",
    "the **explore** function to get the most common venue categories in each\n",
    "neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into\n",
    "clusters. You will use the *k*-means clustering algorithm to complete\n",
    "this task. Finally, you will use the Folium library to visualize the\n",
    "neighborhoods in New York City and their emerging clusters.\n",
